	<h2>About</h2>
	<p>
		I am a Research and Development Software Engineer in the Dell Technologies Office of the CTO
		Dojo. We research emerging technologies and build prototypes to serve as proofs of concept. I'm
		an evangelist of Extreme Programming practices which we follow, so feel free to contact me if
		you want to learn more!
	</p>
	<p>
		Prior to working at Dell I was a Research Scientist at Feature Labs where I worked on the open
		source project Featuretools. You can also check my Github page for a nice cross section of my
		interests, or the programming page on the sidebar.

	<h2>Mathematics</h2>
	<p>
		I studied in algebraic groups over finite fields of positive characteristic. I completed my
		Ph.D. in 2017 under George McNinch at Tufts University in Medford, MA.
	</p>
	<p>
		My thesis work involved constructing unipotent groups by group extensions, and then finding
		representations of nice groups which contain those extensions. My math at this point is a little
		rusty, but If you happen to be interested in representations of unipotent algebraic groups I can
		likely still point you in the right direction.
