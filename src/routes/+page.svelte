	<h2>About</h2>
	<p>
		I am a Research and Development Software Engineer in the Dell Technologies Office of the CTO
		Dojo. We research emerging technologies and build prototypes to serve as proofs of concept. I'm
		an evangelist of <a

			rel="noopener noreferrer">Extreme Programming</a
		> practices which we follow, so feel free to contact me if you want to learn more!
	</p>
	<p>
		Prior to working at Dell I was a Research Scientist at <a
			href="https://www.featurelabs.com/open/"
			target="_blank"
			rel="noopener noreferrer">Feature Labs</a
		>
		where I worked on the open source project
		<a href="https://github.com/alteryx/featuretools" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
			Featuretools.

	<h2>Mathematics</h2>
	<p>
		I studied in algebraic groups over finite fields of positive characteristic. I completed my
		Ph.D. in 2017 under <a
			href="https://math.tufts.edu/people/faculty/george-mcninch"
			target="_blank"
			rel="noopener noreferrer">George McNinch</a
		>
		at
		<a href="https://www.tufts.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tufts University</a> in
		Medford, MA.
	</p>
	<p>
		My thesis work involved constructing unipotent groups by group extensions, and then finding
		representations of nice groups which contain those extensions. My math at this point is a little
		rusty, but If you happen to be interested in representations of unipotent algebraic groups I can
		likely still point you in the right direction.
