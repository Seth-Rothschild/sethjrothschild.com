		My Github page can be found here. If you do data science in Python, you might be interested in
		my package henchman which provides easy methods to generate Bokeh plots among other things. I've
		also worked extensively on Featuretools, which generates features automatically from raw data.

		Emacs users may or may not be interested in scanning through my configuration which is fairly
		readable. Included there is a substantial conditional hydra for keyboard navigation as well as a
		few "common sense" modifications which might be of interest to new users. Of use to math
		graduate students at Tufts is my LaTeX Thesis and Presentation template.
	</p>

		There are a few fun projects you might be interested in as well. I have a contacts manager page
		which tracks interpersonal relationships, a Python package for assigning seats at random for a
		wedding and implementations of thrill digger and Wordle that can quickly play out thousands of
		games according to a strategy.

		When I have the time, I like to contribute on Stack Exchange and on the math subreddits. Feel
		free to ping me on the appropriate site if it's possible I might know the answer to a question
		you have.
